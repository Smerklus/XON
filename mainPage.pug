                                    Nim generates native dependency-free executables, not dependent on a virtual
                                    machine,
                                    which are small and allow easy redistribution.

                                    The Nim compiler and the generated executables support all major platforms like
                                    Windows,
                                    Linux, BSD and macOS.

                                    Fast deferred reference counting memory management that supports real-time

                                    Support for various backends: it compiles to C, C++ or JavaScript so that Nim can
                                    be
                                    used for all backend and frontend needs.
